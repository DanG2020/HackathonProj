# Pear Exchange

Pear Exchange is an all-in-one digital marketplace, where you can post your own ML models and be paid for their use. Once can also purchase a wide variety of AI tokens using our proprietary currency, Juice Pear. 

Users can also purchase stakes in other ML model builders on our platform. This would provide crucial funding for the top creators on our platform, while allowing everyday people to enjoy the financial benefits of the booming AI market. Users would be paid dividends based on the revenue of the individuals or organizations which they invest in.

## Introduction

Pear Chain is designed to provide a decentralized solution for [brief description of the problem your project addresses]. By utilizing the NEAR Protocol, Pear Chain ensures fast, secure, and scalable transactions.

## Features

- **Decentralized**: Built on the NEAR Protocol for enhanced security and transparency.
- **Efficient**: Optimized for fast transaction processing.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless user experience.
- **Real-Time data** See prices fluxate in real time to keep you in the loop.
- **Personal Portfolio** Store all your favorite models on your watch list as well as tracking your current assests.

## How we built it

We built the blockchain backbone and the cryptocurrency for our project using NEAR Protocol, which helped us improve the efficiency and security of our platform. We first designed our frontend on Figma, before building it using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, React, and Chart.JS. We took advantage of the abundance of Financial Information available on the internet to inform the financial aspects of our project.

## What's Next?

We wanted a feature for users to be able to pay Juicy Pears to use our platform to create or personalize AI models. However, we realized quickly that this idea wasn't feasible for the scope of the hackathon. This could be something we look into implementing in the future.
